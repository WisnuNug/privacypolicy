    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the following statements will help you understand how our applications handle personally identifiable information that you sometimes provide to us over the Internet (Google Play Platform).</p>

    <p>In general, we do not collect any personally identifiable information from you when you download our Android applications. To be more specific, we do not require consumers to register before downloading the application, nor do we track consumer visits to our application, nor do we even have a Server to store such personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Advertisements</strong> - Our app may use some providers to display advertisements. These Ad Providers may only use cookies to identify your device (as described above), and then display ads relevant to our type of application. We do not share any user data with Facebook or other parties (Verified by BBC & Privacy International).</p>

    <p><strong>Analytics</strong> - We use a third-party analytics tool, Google Analytics, to help us measure traffic and service usage trends. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our services, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other pages they used before coming to our services. We use information obtained from Google Analytics only to improve our services.</p>

    <h2>How we use your information</h2>
    <p>In the above situations, we guarantee that your personally identifiable information will only be used to contact you and improve our services. We will never use such information (for example your name and email address) for any other purpose, such as to further market our products, or to disclose your personal information to third parties for commercial gain.</p>

    <h2>Contact us</h2>
    <p>Please note that whether or not to send us feedback or bug reports is a completely voluntary initiative at your own discretion. If you are concerned about misuse of your personally identifiable information, or if you would like more information about our privacy policy and what it means, please feel free to let us know, we will strive to provide clear answers to your questions in a timely manner.</p>
